The candidate demonstrated a solid understanding of the differences between labeled and unlabeled data, as well as appropriate examples for each learning type. They also explained the decision tree mechanism well, mentioning feature splits and criteria like information gain and Gini impurity. However, their explanation could have been improved by discussing pruning methods in more detail.',\n",
